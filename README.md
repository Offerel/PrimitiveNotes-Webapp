# PrimitiveNotes (Standalone)
This is a standalone version of PrimitiveNotes for Roundcube for using the notes without the need of Roundcube Webmail. As such, this lacks some of the mail dependent functions from the plugin version. For example, sharing via mail is not possible. On the other hand, the standalone variant is a little bit faster, since its without the bloat of the Webmail client.
